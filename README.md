# Air Quality Prediction Web App

This Flask web application predicts air quality based on input parameters using a pre-trained machine learning model. It's designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily enter air quality parameters and receive instant predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3
- Flask
- pandas
- joblib

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satishkumarmurugan/AQI-prediction-Using-Flask-Web-App/
cd air-quality-prediction
```

2. Install dependencies:

Install Jypter Notebook

## Usage

To run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

After running the app, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. Here, you can enter the air quality parameters in the provided form and submit it for predictions.

## Files and Structure

- `app.py`: The Flask application file.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering pages.
- `airquality.joblib`: The pre-trained machine learning model used for predictions.
